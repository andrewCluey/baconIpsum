Generate some meat and ipsum fillers

## Get the meat!
Simply add this script to your powershell profile and you can generate lots of meat and ipsum fller whenever you like using a simple PowerShell command.

For example:

```powershell
get-meat -Paras 2 -Type all-meat -MakeItSpicy
```

will return something like this:

```text
